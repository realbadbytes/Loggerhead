====================
== INITIAL THOUGHTS
====================

Program to locate companies worth manual homework.
Also to do some of Cramer's 'homework' automatically. Initially, this will consist of:
* Filtering by positive EPS and market cap
* Displaying multiple and whatever other measurements are desired
* Crudely ranking each company within its industry

====================
== PLANNED FEATURES
====================
* Graphing of data
* Alert on very large trade volumes so we can follow hedge funds / portfolio manager moves
* Storing output for comparison with newer output, change detection
* Gather stream of articles related to chosen companies

====================
== RANDOM NOTES
====================
What is homework, really?
* Quarterly and annual report analysis
* Research firm reports
* Local news
* Conference calls
* Product margin evaluation, how much does a company make per sale?
* Competition evaluation
* Market cycle analysis, is the company reliant on cycles?
* How does the business evaluate its health? Revenue, margin, market share, other? What drives macro decisions?
* Is this metric growing faster than competitors?
* DEBT. IS. BAD.

Be careful when using sector average multiples. The data can be massively skewed, especially in sectors
with a small amount of companies. The growth of a single company may throw the average off and make
other companies look massively underperforming, when it isn't really the case. Sector average multiples
should have a long lead up time to combat this effect.

Look for sectors with small numbers of competitors, this will spark buyouts/conglomerate formation. 5-6 top
competitors is a great place to find opportunity, even if they are properly valued from a metrics perspective.
