Why will multiple expand? Multiple anticipates earnings

1. macroeconomic factors - federal reserve cuts interest rates, GDP expansion or contraction
   examine past economic expanses, are conditions similar? its a tide and history repeats itself
   sector rotation is the tide of economics
2. 

recession proof earnings: drug, food, soap, toothpaste, beer, soda
only good before fed cuts interest rates
cyclical companies are getting crushed but these staples still delivery ExM=P
when its good, gtfo. the fed is going to feel this tide and its about to turn
get on the "depressed horse" lol, the cyclical horse

money spigot is anticipated by about 6 months.
cyclical: discretionary items
* just because the ExM=P equation looks favorable, need to evaluate the cyclical nature of the company*

when the analysts downgrade finally, you buy. 

when people start liking the stock again, other value store stocks are probably on sale a bit.
move into those.
economy growth will peak around 3-5%

organic growth stocks that dont depend on interest rates are a different animal - unsinkable.
beginners should trade sector funds as opposed to individual stocks probably

big portfolio managers are catalysts to big moves. just follow their lead

Monitor real interest rates, CPI, PPI, gold, employment, wages
if CPI has 4 straight wins, fed will tighten
must get in before this happens 

3.
companies with no earnings. speculation portion of the portfolio
need a buy and a sell price
small cap stocks
uncovered on wall street, no news.
which themes/sectors is wall street promoting
niche crap. behavioral finance, group psych is a major force here
see DDD. everyone loved it. but it was shite, could have shorted it
no more than 20%
selling below $10, see academic journals, subreddits, new tech
bet on the field, winners make up for losers
early enough means no wall streeters have covered the group yet
observe trading volume, then get in
