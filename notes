Why will multiple expand? Multiple anticipates earnings

1. macroeconomic factors - federal reserve cuts interest rates, GDP expansion or contraction
   examine past economic expanses, are conditions similar? its a tide and history repeats itself
   sector rotation is the tide of economics
2. 

recession proof earnings: drug, food, soap, toothpaste, beer, soda
only good before fed cuts interest rates
cyclical companies are getting crushed but these staples still delivery ExM=P
when its good, gtfo. the fed is going to feel this tide and its about to turn
get on the "depressed horse" lol, the cyclical horse

money spigot is anticipated by about 6 months.
cyclical: discretionary items
* just because the ExM=P equation looks favorable, need to evaluate the cyclical nature of the company*

when the analysts downgrade finally, you buy. 

when people start liking the stock again, other value store stocks are probably on sale a bit.
move into those.
economy growth will peak around 3-5%

organic growth stocks that dont depend on interest rates are a different animal - unsinkable.
beginners should trade sector funds as opposed to individual stocks probably

big portfolio managers are catalysts to big moves. just follow their lead
