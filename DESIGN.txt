== PLANNED FEATURES
====================
What is homework, really?
* Quarterly and annual report analysis
* Research firm reports
* Local news
* Conference calls
* Product margin evaluation, how much does a company make per sale?
* Competition evaluation
* Market cycle analysis, is the company reliant on cycles?
* How does the business evaluate its health? Revenue, margin, market share, other? What drives macro decisions?
* Is this metric growing faster than competitors?
* DEBT. IS. BAD.
